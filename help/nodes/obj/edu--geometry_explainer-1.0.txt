@setupparameters Setup Parameters

== Setup ==
Parameter ||
    Description||

Set Camera |
    #id: setcam
    Drag a Camera object into this parameter to have all text elements always face towards that camera. If empty, text defaults to facing along positive Z axis.

Font Size Override |
    #id: fontsizeoverride
    Shrink all text elements.

Unfold Geometry |
    #id: expand
    Unfold and flatten the geometry cube along predefined cut seams.

Reveal Wireframe |
    #id: fadewireframe
    Fade out the primitive faces and reveal only the wireframe of geometry.

Shared/Unshared |
    #id: pointshared
    Toggle the viewing of unshared points and the point count at each primitive intersection.

Shrink Polygons |
    #id: expandunshared
    Shrink the primitive faces to better reveal how primitives are disconnected when unshared.
    :tip:
        Point and vertex associations can be easier to understand in this mode.

@geocompparameters Geometry Components Parameters

== Attribute Classes ==
NOTE:
* Attribute Classes are the geometry components that are able to have attributes assigned to them. These attributes are carried through your node stream, unless a destructive process is applied at any time that removes them.

* Attribute Classes have a precedence over each other. This means that some attribute data, if applied to more than one class, will only appear on the highest precedence class. The order from highest to lowest is Vertex, Point, Primitive, then Detail.

Parameter ||
    Description||
    
Vertex |
    #id: expandvertex
    Vertex displays each vertex on the geometry associated with each primitive face.

Point |
    #id: expandpoint
    Point displays each point on the geometry associated with each vertex and primitive face.
    :tip:
        When geometry is shared (connected), a single point will be used. When Unshared is used, each vertex will get it's own unique point.

Primitive |
    #id: expandprimitive
    Primitive displays and highlights each polygon face of the geometry.

    NOTE:
        The term *Primitive* is used to describe many things in Houdini. It can be a Polygonal Curve, Metaball, Alembic, primitive objects like a circle, sphere, tetrahedron, tube, etc.. It can also mean a VDB, or a volume, it can also mean a packed primitive, packed disk primitive, packed disk sequence primitive, and polygon soup. Because of this it tends to be a very confusing term to grasp.

Detail |
    #id: expanddetail
    Detail is the entire geometry object.

== Extra Components ==
NOTE:
    * These extra components relate to geometry, but are unable to carry attributes.

Parameter ||
    Description||

UV Seam |
    #id: expandseam
    UV Seam is a group of edges used to define how to flatten a polygon model in UV space. This same group can be used to cut the polygons apart along the same seam.

Edge |
    #id: expandedge
    Edges are undirected and shared between primitive faces.

Half-Edge |
    #id: expandhalfedge
    Half-edges are a directed edge, and have a start vertex and an end vertex. Each boundary edge will have only one half-edge, and shared primitive edges will have two Half-Edges.

Normal |
    #id: expandnormal
    Normal is the facing direction of a polygon face. Normal vector value is normalized to a unit length of 1. The direction is determined by the winding order of the vertices of the polygon.

Reverse Winding |
    #id: reversewinding
    Invert the normal direction.
