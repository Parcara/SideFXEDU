"""This node creates a matrix detail attribute that you can use then to experiment and learn matrix transformations."""

@parameters

    Run Over:
        #id: class
        This parameter is disabled because it's meant to create a detail attribute only.
        But it's still visible on the parameter interface as a reminder.
            
    Attribute Name:
        #id: name
        Name of the matrix attribute you want to create.
        
    Type:
        #id: type
        Choose between a 3x3 or 4x4 matrix.
        
    Mat3:
        #id: mat3
        The values of your 3x3 transformation matrix.
        
    Mat4:
        #id: mat4
        The values of your 4x4 transformation matrix.
    
    Invert:
        #id: invert
        Inverts the tranformation matrix.


NOTE:
    Note that Houdini’s matrices are stored in *row-major order*, so the matrix’s contents are grouped by row.

    To avoid any confusion within the software, we also use row-major based order in the EDU Tools. 
    The labels around the displayed matrix are here as a reminder:
    - Each line represents a vector: vec1, vec2, vec3
    - Each column represents the X, Y, Z coordinates for each vector

    :fig: [Image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Row_and_column_major_order.svg/800px-Row_and_column_major_order.svg.png]
        #display: narrow left
        If we refer to this image:  
        - `vec1 = (a11, a12, a13)`
        - `vec2 = (a21, a22, a23)`
        - `vec3 = (a31, a32, a33)`

    A consequence of the row-major order is that the *order of multiplication is left to right*. So, if you want to transform a vector with a matrix, you multiply the vector by the matrix, in other words: the vector is the left element of the multiplication operand, and the matrix the right element.
    Be careful, as you may be used to column-major matrices where the order of multiplication is the opposite.
